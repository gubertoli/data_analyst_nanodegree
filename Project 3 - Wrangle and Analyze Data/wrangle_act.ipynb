    "## Project Requirements - Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to wrangle the provided dataset using the three-steps approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gather\n",
    "- `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv` provided dataset containing tweets from WeRateDogs twitter account\n",
    "- `image-predictions.tsv` is a dataset with dogs breed inference based on tweet's pictures, to be retrieved using python package `Requests`\n",
    "- using `Tweepy` API to retrieve information from Twitter for each tweet based on its tweet ID. Save all tweets JSON to a `tweet_json.txt` file (each tweet per row)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assess\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a visually and programatic assessment of the data looking for quality and tidiness issues, **detect and document at least 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clean\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform cleaning according to the findings from `Assess` phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Requirements\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "- Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.\n",
    "- Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.\n",
    "- The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "- You do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. You can, but note that you won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data for this Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file with the main one named `twitter_archive_master.csv`. If additional files exist because multiple tables are required for tidiness, name these files appropriately. *Additionally, you may store the cleaned data in a SQLite database (which is to be submitted as well if you do)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze and visualize your wrangled data here. **At least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization must be produced**."
